    answer:
      "Most developers integrate UserBubble in under 5 minutes. Install our SDK via npm (for React Native), import the widget component, and pass your project ID. No backend setup, no API configuration, no complicated authentication flows. Just drop in the component and you're live.",

    question: "Will UserBubble slow down my app?",

  {
    question: "Can I use UserBubble across multiple mobile apps?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Use our React Native SDK for cross-platform mobile apps, or use native Swift and Kotlin SDKs (coming soon) for platform-specific implementations. All feedback flows into one unified dashboard, so you can see votes and requests across all your apps.",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the look and feel of the feedback widget?",
