## Getting Your API Key

Before integrating any SDK, you'll need to generate an API key:

1. Go to your organization settings
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Copy your API key (format: `ub_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
5. Store it securely (use environment variables, never commit to git)

<Callout type="warn">
  Keep your API key secret! It identifies your organization and should never be exposed in public repositories.
</Callout>
