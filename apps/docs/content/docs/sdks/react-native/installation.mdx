## Choose Your Platform

<Tabs items={['Expo', 'Bare React Native']}>
  <Tab value="Expo">
    ### Expo Projects

    For Expo projects, install the SDK along with expo-secure-store:

    ```bash
    npx expo install @userbubble/react-native expo-secure-store
    ```

    The SDK will automatically detect Expo and use `expo-secure-store` for secure data storage.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Bare React Native">
    ### Bare React Native Projects

    For bare React Native projects, install the SDK with AsyncStorage:

    ```bash
    npm install @userbubble/react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
    ```

    Or with yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add @userbubble/react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
    ```

    The SDK will automatically detect bare React Native and use AsyncStorage.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

Check that the package is installed correctly:

```bash
npm list @userbubble/react-native
```

You should see:

```
@userbubble/react-native@0.1.0
```

## Get Your API Key

Before using the SDK, you'll need an API key:

1. Go to your organization settings in Userbubble
2. Navigate to "API Keys"
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Copy the API key (it starts with `ub_live_` or `ub_test_`)

<Callout type="info">
  Store your API key securely in environment variables. Never commit it to your repository.
</Callout>

### Environment Variables

**For Expo:**

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_USERBUBBLE_API_KEY=ub_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**For bare React Native:**

Add to your `.env` file and use a package like `react-native-dotenv`:

```bash
USERBUBBLE_API_KEY=ub_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
